# Fake Store API

This project displays data obtained from the [Fake Store API](https://fakestoreapi.com/) in an HTML table using Bootstrap, CSS, and JavaScript. The table displays information about products. 

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, simply download or clone the repository, and open the `index.html` file in your web browser.

## Built With

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
- Bootstrap

## Usage

Upon loading the `index.html` file, the JavaScript code will fetch data from the Fake Store API using `fetch()`. The data is then parsed from JSON format into JavaScript objects using `.json()`. 

The JavaScript code then dynamically generates an HTML table using the obtained data. Each row of the table displays information about a single product such as its title, description, price, and image.
